💎 Diamond Price Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting diamond prices using structured tabular data.
It focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, following industry-standard ML practices.

📌 Project Overview

Diamond pricing depends on multiple attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and physical dimensions.
This project applies supervised regression models to learn the relationship between diamond features and market price.

The objective is to build a robust, reproducible ML pipeline that produces accurate price predictions and demonstrates practical machine-learning methodology.
